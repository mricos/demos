    <h1>Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)</h1>

    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
        The Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) was developed in the 1960s by Soviet scientist 
        Alexey G. Ivakhnenko as a self-organizing approach to modeling complex systems. Originally 
        designed for aerodynamics applications, it addressed the challenge of automatically 
        discovering mathematical relationships in empirical data without human bias.
    </p>
    <div class="history-explanation">
        <h3>Key Innovations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-organizing algorithm that automatically selects optimal model complexity</li>
            <li>Evolutionary approach to generating and selecting polynomial models</li>
            <li>Built-in validation to prevent overfitting</li>
            <li>Precursor to modern machine learning techniques</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Original Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            GMDH was created to solve two critical challenges in system modeling:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The need to model complex systems without pre-defined assumptions about data structures</li>
            <li>The challenge of selecting appropriate model complexity (polynomial degree) automatically</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        The Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) is an algorithmic approach
        where polynomial models are iteratively generated and selected based on 
        performance on validation data, thereby "growing" a layered structure. 
        In this simulation, each "layer" corresponds to a fresh set of candidate 
        polynomial regressions, and we select only the models that yield the best 
        performance until we either reach a specified layer limit or no further 
        improvement can be gained.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Mathematical Formulation</h2>
    <p>    
        Our polynomial model for a single layer is based on transforming the input 
        data <em>X</em> into polynomial features of degree <em>d</em>. If we let
        <em>X</em> be the input vector, then the polynomial expansion 
        (including constant term) can be represented as:
    </p>

    <p>
        \[
            \phi(X) = \left[ 1, X, X^2, \ldots, X^d \right],
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        where \(\phi(X)\) leads to features used in a multiple linear regression. 
        We apply Ridge Regression to these expanded features, solving:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
            \min_{w} \left\| y - \Phi(X) w \right\|^2 
            + \alpha \left\| w \right\|^2,
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        where \(\alpha\) is the regularization coefficient, and 
        \( w \) is the vector of model coefficients.
    </p>

    <h2>Parameters Description</h2>
    <p>
        The table below lists the key parameters in our GMDH simulation and 
        explains their roles in the algorithm.
    </p>

    <table class="parameter-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Parameter</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><code>maxLayers</code></td>
                <td>
                    The maximum number of layers (iterations) the GMDH 
                    algorithm will attempt to build before stopping.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>degree</code></td>
                <td>
                    The degree of polynomial expansion. Higher degrees can 
                    capture more complex relationships, but risk overfitting.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>modelsPerLayer</code></td>
                <td>
                    The number of candidate polynomial models that are tested 
                    in each new layer. Only the best models (based on 
                    validation error) survive.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>alpha</code></td>
                <td>
                    The ridge regularization parameter. Higher values of 
                    <code>alpha</code> help reduce overfitting by penalizing 
                    large coefficient magnitudes.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Connection to the Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        Each layer in this simulation:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Takes the training data <em>X</em> and <em>y</em>, and a set of best 
        models from the previous layer (or the raw inputs for the first layer).</li>
        <li>Generates polynomial expansions of the selected inputs.</li>
        <li>Trains regression models using the expanded features.</li>
        <li>Evaluates each model on the validation set and picks the top 
        performers.</li>
        <li>These top models are then used to feed predictions into the next layer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        At any point, if no better model can be found or a maximum number of 
        layers is reached, training terminates. The process is driven by 
        performance metrics (mean squared error) that are visualized 
        (training, validation) in real time.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Heat Map Visualization</h2>
    <p>
        The heat map provides a grid visualization of model performance across 
        different layers of the GMDH network. This visualization helps track 
        the evolution and performance of models throughout the training process.
    </p>
    <div class="heatmap-explanation">
        <p>
            The visualization is organized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each <strong>row</strong> represents a different layer in the GMDH network</li>
            <li>Each <strong>column</strong> represents a different model within that layer</li>
            <li>The <strong>color intensity</strong> (using the Viridis colormap) represents the validation Mean Squared Error (MSE):
                <ul>
                    <li>Darker colors indicate better performing models (lower MSE)</li>
                    <li>Lighter colors indicate higher MSE values</li>
                    <li>Gray cells indicate inactive or invalid models</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Each cell displays the actual MSE value in scientific notation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Interactive features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hover over any cell to see detailed information:
                <ul>
                    <li>Layer number</li>
                    <li>Model number</li>
                    <li>MSE value</li>
                    <li>Model status (Active/Inactive)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This visualization helps you understand:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How model performance evolves through layers</li>
            <li>Which models are performing better in each layer</li>
            <li>The distribution of model performance across the network</li>
            <li>The number of active models in each layer</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Layer Structure</h2>
    <p>
        The GMDH algorithm builds a network structure layer by layer, visualized as a directed graph 
        where each layer contains multiple polynomial models. The structure shows both the progression 
        of training and the connections between layers.
    </p>
    <div class="layer-explanation">
        <h3>Visual Elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Model Nodes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Green circles (✓): Accepted models (top 50% by validation MSE)</li>
                    <li>Red circles (✗): Rejected models</li>
                    <li>Yellow circles (⟳): Currently evaluating</li>
                    <li>Gray circles (?): Not yet evaluated</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Node Information:
                <ul>
                    <li>Number inside circle: Model index within layer</li>
                    <li>Number below circle: Validation MSE (when available)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Connections:
                <ul>
                    <li>Gray lines show connections from accepted models to the next layer</li>
                    <li>Only top-performing models (lowest validation MSE) connect to the next layer</li>
                    <li>Connection opacity indicates the strength of the relationship</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Layer-to-Layer Information Transfer</h3>
        <p>
            Information flows between layers in the following way:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>For the first layer:
                <ul>
                    <li>Input is the raw training data X</li>
                    <li>Features are created by polynomial expansion: [1, X, X², ..., Xᵈ]</li>
                    <li>Each model learns coefficients for these polynomial features</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For subsequent layers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Input becomes the <em>predictions</em> from the best model of the previous layer</li>
                    <li>Specifically: X_next = predict(X_current, best_model_coefficients)</li>
                    <li>These predictions are then used to create new polynomial features</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            This can be seen in the code where predictions become new inputs:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            // Get predictions from best model
            const nextX_train = bestModels.map(model => 
                predict(polyX_train.map(row => model.features.map(i => row[i])), model.model)
            );
            
            // Use these predictions as input for next layer
            X_train = nextX_train[0];  // Use predictions from best model
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Training Process</h3>
        <p>
            The network grows progressively:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Each layer evaluates <code>modelsPerLayer</code> candidate models</li>
            <li>Models are evaluated one at a time (shown in yellow during evaluation)</li>
            <li>After layer completion:
                <ul>
                    <li>Top 50% of models (by validation MSE) are accepted (green)</li>
                    <li>Remaining models are rejected (red)</li>
                    <li>Accepted models feed their predictions to all models in the next layer</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Process continues until:
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximum number of layers is reached (<code>maxLayers</code>)</li>
                    <li>Or no further improvement in validation error is found</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
