# repl_c - C REPL for tau-engine

Placeholder for C-based REPL implementation.

## Purpose

A lightweight, native C REPL for direct tau-engine control without Python runtime.

## Planned Features

- Unix socket communication with tau-engine
- Readline-style input with history
- Command completion
- Minimal dependencies (libc, readline)

## Build

```bash
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./tau-repl
```

## Status

Not yet implemented. See `repl_py/` for Python implementation.
