Nonduality is the understanding that there is no real separation
between self and other, subject and object, or mind and world. It
points to a direct experience of reality where all distinctions
dissolve, revealing a unified presence or awareness. Many
spiritual traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta and Zen Buddhism,
describe nonduality as the essence of true awakening or
enlightenment.
