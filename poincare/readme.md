# Poincaré disk model

## From wikipedia

In geometry, the Poincaré disk model, also caled the conformal
disk model, is a model of 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry
in which the points of the geometery are inside the unit disk,
and the straight lines consist of all circular arcs contained
within that disk that are orthogonal to the boundary of the
disk, plus all diameters of disk.

The isometry group of the disk model is given by the special
unitary group SU(1,).


## History
Along wit the Klein model and the Poincare half-sapce model,
it was proposed by Eugenio Beltrami who used thise models
to show taht hyperbolic geometry wwas equiconsistent wit
Euclideen geometry. It is named afer Henri Poincaré, because
his rediscovery of this representation fourteen years later
become better known than the origianl work of Beltrami.
