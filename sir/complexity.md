⏺ Project Summary: SIR Toy Model

  This is a SIR epidemiological simulation built as a vanilla JavaScript single-page application. It
  models disease spread using an agent-based approach.

  Key Features:

  - Agent-based simulation: Individual agents perform random walks in a 2D field
  - SIR model: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Recovered (R) compartments
  - Real-time visualization:
    - Agent field canvas showing individual movement and states
    - Time series chart tracking S/I/R populations over time
    - Experiment tracking system
  - Interactive controls: Adjustable parameters for population size, infection rate, recovery rate,
  contact radius, agent speed, and R₀ targeting
  - Design system: Dark theme with custom CSS design tokens and polished UI

  Technical Stack:

  - Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
  - Canvas-based rendering for both field and charts
  - Responsive drawer/panel UI system with FABs
  - Document panel with tabbed navigation

  Project Structure:

  /Users/mricos/src/mricos/demos/cell/sir/
  ├── sir.html          - Main application (large, ~28k tokens)
  ├── sir.css           - Design system and styling
  ├── sir-docs.html     - Documentation
  └── index-min.html    - Minimal version

  Current Status:

  ✓ Working simulation with full UI
  ✓ Polished design system
  ✓ Parameter controls and presets
  ✓ Experiment tracking

  The project appears complete and functional. No obvious issues in git status for this specific
  directory. Ready for testing or enhancements as needed.

⏺ SIR Toy Model - Complexity Analysis Complete

  I've completed a comprehensive complexity analysis of your codebase. Here are the key findings:

  ---
  Complexity Score: 8.5/10 (Very High)

  Critical Issues 🔴

  1. Monster Function: setupDocsTabs() is 1,055 lines with cyclomatic complexity ~120
    - Should be broken into 15-20 smaller functions
    - Location: sir.html:187-1242
  2. Monolithic Architecture: All 2,145 lines in one HTML file
    - 1,999 lines of JavaScript in inline <script>
    - No module system, no separation of concerns
    - 76 functions and 338 const declarations in single closure
  3. Performance Bottleneck: O(N²) collision detection (sir.html:2080-2087)
    - Becomes critical with N>500 agents
    - Needs spatial hash grid for O(N) performance
  4. Zero Documentation & Tests
    - No JSDoc comments
    - No unit tests
    - No error handling (localStorage, canvas operations)

  Code Metrics

  | Metric                    | Value        | Status       |
  |---------------------------|--------------|--------------|
  | Total Lines (JS)          | 1,999        | 🔴 Very High |
  | Longest Function          | 1,055 lines  | 🔴 Critical  |
  | Max Cyclomatic Complexity | ~120         | 🔴 Critical  |
  | Max Nesting Depth         | 7 levels     | 🟡 High      |
  | Global State Variables    | 14           | 🟡 High      |
  | Event Listeners           | 80+          | 🟡 High      |
  | Code Duplication          | 6+ instances | 🟡 Moderate  |

  Maintainability Score: 3/10 (Poor)

  ---
  Top 3 Refactoring Priorities

  1. Break apart setupDocsTabs() into focused modules:
    - Font controls, color system, undo/redo, config persistence
  2. Extract design token system to separate file with utilities:
    - Color conversion, variant generation, palette management
  3. Implement spatial indexing for collision detection:
    - Replace O(N²) with O(N) using grid-based approach

  ---
  Positive Findings ✅

  Despite the complexity issues, the code shows strong engineering:
  - Proper IIFE encapsulation
  - Consistent DPR handling for high-resolution displays
  - Fixed timestep physics (proper game loop)
  - Sophisticated undo/redo with history stack
  - LocalStorage persistence

  Verdict: This has evolved from a "toy model" into a production-grade application trapped in a
  prototype's architecture. With ~20-30 hours of targeted refactoring, it could become highly
  maintainable.

  Would you like me to start refactoring any specific component?
