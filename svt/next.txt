SVT FRAMEWORK STATUS & NEXT ACTIONS

CURRENT STATE:
- Cell-based widget system (1c/2c/takeover sizing)
- Gear state machine: closed->open->takeover (unstacking works)
- Design tokens added, reduced complexity
- Visual Stage integrated as control cell
- Gear-only takeover exit (clean UX)

CONFIRMED DUPLICATIONS:
1. Inspector display: modal (878-889) + takeover (1009-1025) 
2. Populate functions: 4x modal + updateSelectedModeInspector()
3. CSS: .inspector-tab styles duplicated for both contexts

SEMANTICS CLARIFIED:
Panel > Section > Cell > Widget
- Widget: individual control (slider, button)
- Cell: grid unit in control panel (1c, 2c, takeover)
- Panel: full interface (control panel, inspector)  
- Section: content group (concept-section)

PRIORITY REFACTOR:
1. Unify inspector rendering (eliminate duplication)
2. Make left column data-driven (conceptSections array)
3. Single InspectorRenderer class for both modal/takeover

CURRENT LINE COUNT: ~1400 lines
WORKING FEATURES: All cell transitions, gear navigation, real-time updates

NEXT SESSION GOALS:
- Refactor inspector duplication
- Data-driven left column
- Code cleanup/organization
